This is the Tagger project. 

The Tagger project is a library making it possible to extract relevant tags (keywords and named entities) from texts. 

Tags can be diambiguated and rated by relevancy.

The library can be included in a webservice wrapper (https://github.com/40c/tagger-webservice) or it can be integrated in to your faviourite CMS (ie Drupal: http://drupal.org/project/tagger)
